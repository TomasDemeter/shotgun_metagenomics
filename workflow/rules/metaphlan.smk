If you have installed MetaPhlAn using Anaconda, it is advised to install the database in a folder outside the Conda environment. To do this, run
metaphlan --install --bowtie2db <database folder>
and add the database directory to config.yaml file

If you install the database in a different location, remember to run MetaPhlAn using --bowtie2db <database folder>!
